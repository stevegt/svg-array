# svg-array
Create an array of svg objects from a single input object, e.g. for laser cutting multiples.

This was created quickly for COVID-19 response and needs better CLI and documentation.  For now, see the "usage" comment in https://github.com/stevegt/svg-array/blob/master/svg-array and the example in https://github.com/stevegt/svg-array/blob/master/example/run.
